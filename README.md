## Customizing CoreBots

Use the C.B.O. plugin, don't know what that is? C.B.O. stands for CoreBots Options, this is a plugin that is now found in your plugins folder (if you installed correctly) which will give you a new menu in _RBot_ > _Menubar_ > _Plugins_ > _CoreBots Options_. This will allow you to customize a large portion of CoreBots, this was already possible beforehand, but now it's made a lot more user-friendly, it can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Scripts/releases) with the scripts bundle.

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I download the scripts?  
**A:**

> **Note:** With RBot 4.1 you can download the scripts directly from the client, click _Scripts_ > _Get Scripts_ then _Download All_.

- Go to the [Releases link](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/Scripts/releases);
- From the latest upload, download the **Scripts.zip** folder under _Assets_;
- Place the **Scripts.zip** inside your _RBot Scripts folder_;
- Right click **Scripts.zip** and click **"_Extract here_"**;
- If prompted to replace your files, click **_Yes_**;
- All should be good to use now!

> **Note:** The current latest RBot version (as long as I update it) can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/BrenoHenrike/RBot/releases).

**Q:** I try to run CoreBots/Dailys/Farms and get an error, what do I do?  
**A:** All files starting with **"_Core_"** **aren't bots**, they are used by bots.

**Q:** I'm running a bot and I get an error like _"The type or namespace 'CoreBots' could not be found"_, how do I fix it?  
**A:** That's an installation problem, certify that you dropped the **"_Scripts_"** folder directly in the **"_RBot.exe_"** folder, this way it will update all previous bots that you downloaded from here. A common error is your file path be like: _"\.../Rbot/Scripts/**Scripts**/CoreBots.cs"_ or even _"\.../Rbot/**Scripts-master/Scripts**/CoreBots.cs"_ it should be _"\.../Rbot/**Scripts**/CoreBots.cs"_.
> **Note:** If after you follow this answer the error persists, open the script you got an error and certify that the first lines with `//cs_include` have the right path/file name, typos happen.

**Q:** Even after doing the solutions above my script doesn't run, what now?  
**A:** Then I might have messed up something. In this case you can reach out to me in Discord: **Breno_Henrike#6959** or **Lord Exelot#9674** and tell which script, the part the problem occurred and the version of RBot you are having trouble with, you can also use the channel _#rbot-questions-help_ [in this server](https://discord.io/AQWBots/).

**Q:** What is M.A.S. ?
**A:** M.A.S. stands for Master Advanced Skills. It's a Master file that is inside the Skills folder that has a Advanced Skill combo for each class that could benefit from having one. If you disagree with one of our choices and have a better one in mind, send us a message in the _#rbot-questions-help_ channel in the [AuQW Discord server](https://discord.io/AQWBots).
