## FAQ
**Q:** How do I download the scripts?  
**A:** Click in the green **"*Code*"** button then in **"*Download ZIP*"**, from WinRar/7z you can drag and drop the **"*Scripts*"** folder directly in the **"*RBot.exe*"** folder like in the gif above.

**Q:** I try to run CoreBots/Dailys/Farms and get an error, what do I do?  
**A:** All files starting with **"*Core*"** aren't bots, they are used by bots.

**Q:** I'm running a bot and I get an error like *"The type or namespace 'CoreBots' could not be found"*, how do I fix it?  
**A:** That's an installation problem, certify that you dropped the **"*Scripts*"** folder directly in the **"*RBot.exe*"** folder, this way it will update all previous bots that you downloaded from here. A commom error is your file path be like: *"\*/Rbot/Scripts/**Scripts**/FarmAllDailys.cs"* or even *"\*/Rbot/**Rbot-Scripts-master/Scripts**/FarmAllDailys.cs"* it should be *"\*/Rbot/**Scripts**/FarmAllDailys.cs"*.

**Q:** Even after doing the solutions above my script doesn't run, what now?  
**A:** Then I might have messed up something. In this case you can reach out to me in Discord: **Breno_Henrike#6959** and tell me which script you are having trouble with.
